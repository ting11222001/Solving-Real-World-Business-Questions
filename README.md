## What I’m going to make and Why I’m doing it
This is my hands-on project of how the entire journey of data analysis looks like: from observing the data, defining some high-level business questions according to the data I have, cleaning data, to plotting charts and graphs to visualize results.

## Environment used in this project
I'm using Python3 in anaconda.

## Skills used in this project
* Import sets of csv data files and concatenate them
* Sort through data according to date and reset index
* Drop NaN values from DataFrame
* Remove rows based on a condition
* Change data type of values in columns for our use
* Add columns by splitting cell values from other columns, etc.
* Use .apply, .transform, .map functions to manipulate cells
* Use .groupby function to perform aggregate analysis
* Plot charts using pandas DataFrame method
